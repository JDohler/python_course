I'm working with a microgrid power management system. I have data from renewable energies, energy prices, 
renewable prices, and a demand profile as well. So, I was planning to analyze these data in the aspects:

- The renewable energy produced is enough to supply the demand? 
- Is it worth buying energy from the grid or using renewable? 


That is my thought. I need to go through more details about the cases I would like to present, but the 
main idea is this one. Let me know what do you think.
