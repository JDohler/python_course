The Traveling Salesperson Problem

Consider the Traveling Salesperson Problem :

Given a set of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest
possible tour that visits each city exactly once, and returns to the starting city?
Create a package that tries to find a good solution for the traveling salesperson problem which
takes a matrix with the distances between the points and outputs the best solution found. Try it
out on the 10 largest Swedish cities.
Make a pip package out of it including dependencies. Add CI using Travis, testing installation
from pip and running the 10 cities example.
